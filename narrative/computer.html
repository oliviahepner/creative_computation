I could read him like a book, this creepy kid was going <br>through my computer when I was out. I knew he did it but I decided not to pursue it. I went to get into bed and put on my pajamas,<br> I realized they had been moved around as well. I knew I'd be out of there tommorrow so I decided not to say anything. </p>
