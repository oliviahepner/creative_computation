They were looking down and I couldn't see their face, but as I paid attention I noticed the clicking noises were<br> coming from the doorknob! I was sure they were trying to open our door so I went to call campus police, they showed up in under five minutes, and only then did I feel like it was safe to open up the door.  </p>
