<div class="line"><a href="surprise.html"><p> The next day I meet my new roommate in the same building, everything went well. After talking with my new roommate we turned off the lights<br> and went to bed. For the third night in a row I woke up at some odd hour of the night to a strange noise. I started to hear a small tapping sound,<br> about two every 30 seconds. I tip-toed across the room hoping it was just a floorboard creaking but it was actually coming from the other side of the door. </p>
